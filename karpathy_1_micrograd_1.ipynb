        "**Introduction**\n",
        "- The lecturer, Andrej, introduces the topic of deep neural networks and explains that he will provide an in-depth look at what happens under the hood during neural network training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Micrograd Overview**\n",
        "- Micrograd is a library released by Andre on GitHub.\n",
        "- It's an autograd engine, with \"autograd\" meaning \"automatic gradient\".\n",
        "- The primary purpose of Micrograd is to implement backpropagation, which allows for the efficient evaluation of the gradient of a loss function concerning a neural network's weights.\n",
        "- Modern deep neural network libraries, like PyTorch and Jaxx, rely on backpropagation.\n",
        "- Andrej provides an illustrative example, demonstrating how Micrograd can build mathematical expressions. The library can perform operations like addition, multiplication, power, division, etc.\n",
        "- Micrograd can also perform a backward pass, which initiates backpropagation. This helps in evaluating the derivative of the output concerning various internal nodes and inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Neural Networks as Mathematical Expressions**\n",
        "- Andrej emphasizes that neural networks are just mathematical expressions. While the example provided earlier was arbitrary, neural networks are more structured yet based on the same foundational concepts.\n",
        "- Backpropagation is a general concept and doesn't just apply to neural networks.\n",
        "- Andrej mentions that Micrograd works on scalar values, which is not efficient for production but is pedagogically useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simplicity of Micrograd**\n",
        "- Micrograd's core engine consists of just 100 lines of Python code.\n",
        "- The neural network library built on top of Micrograd is also very concise, focusing on the essential concepts of neurons, layers, and multi-layer perceptrons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Understanding Derivatives**\n",
        "- Andrej delves into the fundamental concept of derivatives, using a simple function as an example.\n",
        "- He explains the definition of a derivative and shows how to compute it numerically for a scalar function.\n",
        "- The slope of the function at various points is discussed, providing an intuitive understanding of the derivative's meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Derivative of a Function with Multiple Inputs**\n",
        "- The lecture progresses to a more complex case where the function has multiple inputs.\n",
        "- Andrej demonstrates how to compute the derivative of the function concerning each input and interprets the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Closing Remarks**\n",
        "- The lecture aims to provide foundational knowledge before diving into neural networks.\n",

        "\n",
        "The lecturer provided a comprehensive exploration of how automatic differentiation works in deep learning. Here's a summary of the key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Value Object**: The core of the system is a 'Value' object that contains a scalar value. This object serves as the foundation for building mathematical expressions.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Mathematical Expressions**: Neural networks can be thought of as large mathematical expressions. These expressions are built using various operations like addition and multiplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Operator Overloading**: Python's magic methods (e.g., `__add__`, `__mul__`) are used to define how Value objects should be combined using basic arithmetic operations. This is the essence of operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Constructing Expressions**: By using these overloaded operations, complex mathematical expressions can be built from Value objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Expression Graph**: As the mathematical expressions are constructed, a graph is built in the background. This graph captures the relationships between Value objects and the operations that produce them.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Visualizing the Graph**: A visualization tool displays the expression graph, helping to visually understand the flow of computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Backpropagation**: The core of training neural networks. Starting from the end of the graph, the gradient (or derivative) is propagated backward. This gradient indicates how much a small change in a Value object would affect the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Chain Rule**: A fundamental calculus principle used during backpropagation. It allows the computation of derivatives through function compositions. If a variable \\( z \\) depends on \\( y \\), which depends on \\( x \\), then the derivative of \\( z \\) with respect to \\( x \\) can be computed by chaining the derivatives together.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Gradient Computation**: Using the chain rule, the gradient of the output with respect to each Value object in the graph is computed. This gradient indicates how sensitive the output is to a change in that Value.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Gradient Verification**: After computing the gradients, they are verified using a numerical approach. By slightly perturbing each Value and observing the change in the output, the computed gradient can be cross-checked.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lecture emphasized the importance of understanding backpropagation and the chain rule in neural network training. By manually implementing and visualizing these concepts, one gains a deeper appreciation for the intricate dance of operations that allow neural networks to learn from data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Preview of a Single Optimization Step**\n",
        "- The goal is to nudge inputs to increase the value of \\( l \\).\n",
        "- For optimization, inputs such as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( f \\) should increase in the direction of the gradient by a small step amount. This is known as the step size.\n",
        "- By nudging all values in the direction of the gradient, the expectation is that \\( l \\) will become less negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Manual Backpropagation Example #2: A Neuron**\n",
        "- A neuron in the context of neural networks is discussed. Neurons have inputs (\\( x \\)) and weights (\\( w \\)) associated with synapses.\n",
        "- The neuron also has a bias, which can make it more or less \"trigger happy.\"\n",
        "- The output of the neuron is the activation function applied to the dot product of the weights and the inputs.\n",
        "- The tanh function is used as an example activation function. It squashes its input values between -1 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementing Backward Function for Operations**\n",
        "- Instead of doing backpropagation manually, the backward function is introduced to automate the process.\n",
        "- The backward function uses the chain rule from calculus to propagate gradients backward in the computation graph.\n",
        "- For addition, the gradient simply flows to both inputs equally.\n",
        "- For multiplication, the gradient of one input is the value of the other input multiplied by the gradient of the output.\n",
        "- For the tanh function, the gradient is \\( 1 - \\text{{tanh}}^2(x) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Backpropagation Through a Neuron Example**\n",
        "- An example neuron is set up, taking two inputs, \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\), and two weights, \\( w1 \\) and \\( w2 \\).\n",
        "- Backpropagation is performed by calling the backward function on each node in the computation graph.\n",
        "- This process propagates the gradient from the output of the neuron back to its inputs and weights.\n",
        "- Using the backward function automates the gradient computation and makes backpropagation easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this lecture segment provided a deep dive into the mechanics of backpropagation, starting with the intuition of nudging inputs to optimize a value, followed by the manual backpropagation process for a neuron, and then introducing a more automated approach using the backward function.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The lecturer discussed the need to implement a backward function for an entire expression graph.\n",
        "- The process involves going backward through a mathematical expression to ensure that the backward function of a node is called only after all its subsequent nodes have been processed.\n",
        "- This ordering can be achieved using a technique called topological sort. In topological sort, all edges of a graph are directed from left to right.\n",
        "  \n",
        "## Building a Topological Graph\n",
        "\n",
        "- A topological graph is built by maintaining a set of visited nodes.\n",
        "- Starting from a root node, the function checks if a node has been visited. If not, it marks it as visited and then iterates through all of its children.\n",
        "- A node is only added to the topological list after all of its children have been processed.\n",
        "  \n",
        "## Backpropagation Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "- The process starts by setting the gradient of the output node to 1.\n",
        "- Next, the topological order of nodes is built.\n",
        "- Nodes are processed in reverse order, ensuring that each node's backward function is called only after its children.\n",
        "  \n",
        "## Addressing Backpropagation Bugs\n",
        "\n",
        "- A potential bug arises when a node is used multiple times in computations.\n",
        "- The gradients should accumulate (using +=) rather than being overwritten.\n",
        "  \n",
        "## Implementing Additional Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "- To create more complex computations, operations like exponentiation, addition, subtraction, and division were added.\n",
        "- The lecturer demonstrated how to achieve operations like division by using a combination of multiplication and the power function.\n",
        "  \n",
        "## PyTorch Comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "- PyTorch, a modern deep learning library, offers a similar approach but at a more efficient scale.\n",
        "- In PyTorch, computations are done using tensors (n-dimensional arrays).\n",
        "- Tensors in PyTorch have `data` and `grad` attributes, similar to the custom implementation.\n",
        "- Operations on tensors in PyTorch are more efficient due to parallel processing capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the lecturer demonstrated the principles of backpropagation, the importance of topological sorting in the process, and provided a practical implementation using a custom solution and compared it with PyTorch.\n",

        "### Manual Backpropagation: Building Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we delve into automating backpropagation, it's invaluable to manually walk through the process. This hands-on approach sharpens our understanding and intuition about how gradients flow backward through a computational graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Starting Point: The Loss Gradient\n",
        "\n",
        "We begin with the final node, the Loss \\( L \\). The gradient of the loss with respect to itself, \\( $\\frac{dL}{dL}$ \\), is trivially \\( 1 \\). This is because any quantity differentiated with respect to itself is always \\( 1 \\). In the code, this is updated as `L.grad = 1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Multiplying Nodes: A Simple Case\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering the equation \\( L = d $\\times$ f \\), we want to find out how the loss changes concerning small changes in \\( d \\) and \\( f \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "For multiplication, backpropagation is straightforward:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The gradient of \\( L \\) with respect to \\( d \\) is \\( f \\). In other words, \\( $\\frac{dL}{dd}$ = f \\).\n",
        "- The gradient of \\( L \\) with respect to \\( f \\) is \\( d \\). Similarly, \\( $\\frac{dL}{df}$ = d \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes intuitive sense: if we increase \\( d \\) by a tiny amount, the change in \\( L \\) would be proportional to the current value of \\( f \\), and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code, this understanding is captured as:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "d.grad = f.data\n",
        "f.grad = d.data\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Visualizing the Computational Graph\n",
        "\n",
        "To help us visually grasp the flow of gradients, the function `draw_dot` is employed. This function renders the computational graph, showing each node's data and gradient values. By visualizing the graph, we can get a clearer picture of the relationships between nodes and how gradients propagate through the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Go Through This Manual Process?\n",
        "\n",
        "Manually computing gradients and visualizing the graph serves a dual purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Deep Understanding:** By manually computing and updating gradients, we get an intimate understanding of backpropagation's inner workings.\n",
        "2. **Verification:** Later, when we implement automatic backpropagation, this manual process will serve as a reference. If our automated gradients match our manual computations, it's a good indication that our implementation is correct.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "As we further traverse the computational graph backwards, our next stop is node \\( a \\). Given the relationship \\( e = a $\\times$ b \\), our goal is to compute the gradient \\( $\\frac{dL}{da}$ \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Multiplication and the Chain Rule\n",
        "\n",
        "For the multiplication operation, the gradient of the output with respect to one of its inputs is equal to the value of the other input. This is because a small change in one input will cause the output to change by an amount proportional to the value of the other input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Formally, for \\( e = a \\times b \\):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The local derivative \\( $\\frac{de}{da}$ \\) is \\( b \\). This captures the rate of change of \\( e \\) concerning changes in \\( a \\).\n",

        "\n",
        "However, we're interested in how changes in \\( a \\) (or \\( b \\)) affect our final loss \\( L \\), not just the intermediate value \\( e \\). For this, we apply the chain rule of differentiation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the chain rule, the gradient of the loss \\( L \\) with respect to \\( a \\) is:\n",

        "\n",
        "The chain rule can be thought of as a way to \"chain\" or link local effects (how \\( a \\) changes \\( e \\)) with global effects (how changing \\( e \\) impacts \\( L \\)). This chaining of local and global changes is the essence of backpropagation.\n",

        "By understanding and applying the chain rule at each step, especially at multiplication nodes, we can efficiently compute the gradient of the loss with respect to any node in our computational graph. This step-by-step approach is foundational for updating weights in neural networks, leading to learning and model optimization.\n",

        "### Manual Backpropagation: A Journey from \\( L \\) to the Leaf Nodes\n",
        "\n",
        "Backpropagation is the cornerstone technique that allows neural networks to learn from errors. It revolves around calculating the gradient of a loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, and then adjusting the weights in the direction that decreases the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Starting Point: The Loss \\( L \\)\n",
        "\n",
        "We began at the end of the computational graph with the Loss \\( L \\). The gradient of the loss with respect to itself, \\( $\\frac{dL}{dL}$ \\), is always \\( 1 \\), because any quantity differentiated with respect to itself is unity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Moving Backward: The Multiplication Node \\( $L = d \\times f$ \\)\n",
        "\n",
        "From \\( L \\), we moved to its immediate predecessors, \\( d \\) and \\( f \\). We observed that:\n",
        "- The gradient of \\( L \\) with respect to \\( d \\) is \\( f \\), and vice versa. This is because multiplication is commutative, and a tiny change in \\( d \\) will result in a change in \\( L \\) proportional to \\( f \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "This step was a local application of the chain rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Further Back: The Addition Node \\( $d = e + c$ \\)\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we tackled the node \\( d \\). Here, \\( d \\) is a result of adding \\( e \\) and \\( c \\). The local derivatives are straightforward for addition:\n",
        "- \\( $\\frac{dd}{de}$ = 1 \\) and \\( $\\frac{dd}{dc}$ = 1 \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using these, we computed:\n",
        "- \\( $\\frac{dL}{de}$ = $\\frac{dL}{dd} \\times \\frac{dd}{de}$ \\)\n",
        "\n",
        "- \\( $\\frac{dL}{dc} = \\frac{dL}{dd} \\times \\frac{dd}{dc}$ \\)\n",
        "\n",
        "This step again showcased a local application of the chain rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Delving Deeper: The Multiplication Node \\( $e = a \\times b$ \\)\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point, we backpropagated further to node \\( e \\) and its predecessors \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). For multiplication:\n",
        "- The gradient of \\( e \\) with respect to \\( a \\) is \\( b \\), and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the local derivatives and previously computed gradient for \\( e \\), we found:\n",
        "- \\( $\\frac{dL}{da} = \\frac{dL}{de} \\times b$ \\)\n",
        "\n",
        "This step, like the previous ones, is a local application of the chain rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Recursive Nature of Backpropagation\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this journey, there’s an evident pattern:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding the Operation:** At each node, we understand the operation that produced the node's value (be it addition, multiplication, etc.).\n",
        "2. **Computing Local Derivatives:** We compute the local derivatives at that node, representing how the node's value changes with respect to its immediate inputs.\n",
        "3. **Applying the Chain Rule:** Using the chain rule, we combine these local derivatives with the gradients we have already computed from subsequent nodes to get the gradients for the current node's inputs.\n",
        "4. **Using Pointers to Traverse:** We use the pointers to the children nodes to move backward recursively through the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is a piece-by-piece, local-to-global, recursive application of the chain rule. It ensures that every node in the computation graph receives the gradient information it needs, which in turn is used to adjust the model's parameters and reduce the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, our manual backpropagation is a systematic walk backward through the computational graph, recursively applying the chain rule to propagate gradients from the output all the way to the leaf nodes. This step-by-step process illuminates the inner workings of backpropagation, which, in more complex systems, gets automated but fundamentally remains the same."

        "Let's break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`a.grad`**: This represents the gradient (or derivative) of the loss with respect to `a.data`. In other words, it indicates how much the loss function will change if `a.data` is changed by a tiny amount. A positive gradient means increasing `a.data` will increase the loss, while a negative gradient means increasing `a.data` will decrease the loss.\n",
        "2. **`0.01`**: This is known as the learning rate. It determines the step size during the gradient descent update. By multiplying the gradient with this value, we scale down the update to avoid making too large a change to `a.data` which might overshoot the optimal value.\n",
        "3. **`a.data +=`**: This is updating the value of `a.data` by adding the computed adjustment (i.e., the product of the learning rate and the gradient). The goal of this update is to reduce the loss.\n",

        "New Value of 'a': a.data = a.data + Adjustment\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The statement `a.data += 0.01 * a.grad` is a shorthand that combines multiplication and addition. Here's the long form in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Step 1: Compute the product of the learning rate (0.01) and the gradient\n",
        "gradient_update = 0.01 * a.grad\n",

        "# Step 2: Add the computed product to the current value of a.data\n",
        "a.data = a.data + gradient_update\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the multiplication (`*`) operator has higher precedence than the addition (`+`) operator, so in the original shorthand, `0.01 * a.grad` gets computed first, and then its result gets added to `a.data`. Breaking it down into multiple steps, as shown above, can make the operations more explicit and clear.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, the code is adjusting the value of `a.data` in the direction that decreases the loss, with the magnitude of the adjustment being controlled by the learning rate and the gradient. This is a basic step in the gradient descent optimization algorithm used in training neural networks and other machine learning models.\n"

        "### The Role of Activation Functions in Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Introduction of Non-linear Properties:**  \n",
        "Neural networks, at their core, involve a series of linear transformations. These are matrix multiplications by weights followed by additions of biases. If we were to stack multiple layers of just these linear operations, no matter how many, the entire network would still behave like a single-layer linear model. This is because the composition of linear functions is always linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Activation functions introduce non-linearities after each linear transformation. When you sandwich a non-linear activation function between two linear layers, the entire composition becomes non-linear. This allows the model to break away from the confines of linearity and enables it to approximate virtually any function, given enough parameters and data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Learning from Errors and Making Adjustments:**  \n",
        "The backpropagation algorithm, which is used to train neural networks, relies on gradients or derivatives. These gradients, calculated using the chain rule of calculus, indicate the direction and magnitude to adjust the weights and biases. Activation functions play a vital role in this gradient calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The non-linear nature of activation functions ensures that small changes in weights can result in significant changes in the output, allowing the model to adjust and correct errors. Without non-linearity, the gradients would either be too uniform or flat, making learning from errors challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Essential for Capturing Complex Patterns:**  \n",
        "Real-world data is rarely linear. Think about images, texts, or intricate patterns and relationships in numerical data. These complexities cannot be captured or represented accurately with just linear transformations. Activation functions, by introducing non-linearities, enable neural networks to learn hierarchical features from data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, in image recognition, lower layers might learn edges, the next layers might learn shapes by combining edges, and even higher layers might recognize complex structures by combining shapes. This hierarchical feature learning is made possible due to the non-linear transformations introduced by activation functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, activation functions are pivotal in transforming a neural network from a simple linear regressor to a powerful function approximator capable of learning and representing intricate patterns in data."

        "The concept of an activation function has its roots in the earliest models of artificial neurons and has evolved alongside the development of artificial neural networks. Let's trace its historical journey:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Biological Inspiration (1940s-1950s):**  \n",
        "   The idea of artificial neurons was inspired by biological neurons. In biological systems, a neuron fires (or activates) in response to a sufficient amount of input signal. This firing can be seen as an \"all-or-nothing\" activation function. The first artificial neuron model, the McCulloch-Pitts neuron (1943), had a binary threshold activation, mimicking this biological firing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Perceptron and Threshold Activation (1957):**  \n",
        "   The Perceptron, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, utilized a threshold-based activation. If the weighted sum of the inputs exceeded a threshold, the perceptron would output one value (often +1), and if not, it would output another (often -1 or 0). This is a linear classification mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Backpropagation and the Sigmoid (1980s):**  \n",
        "   The backpropagation algorithm, introduced in the 1980s, required differentiable activation functions to compute the gradient used in weight updates. The sigmoid (logistic) function, which is S-shaped and maps any input to a value between 0 and 1, became popular. Its differentiable nature and resemblance to the firing rate of biological neurons made it a suitable choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Tanh and Other Functions (Late 1980s-1990s):**  \n",
        "   The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function, which maps inputs to values between -1 and 1, emerged as an alternative to the sigmoid. Being zero-centered, it sometimes led to faster convergence during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **ReLUs and Modern Activation Functions (2010s):**  \n",
        "   The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and its variants became popular in the 2010s. ReLU, which outputs the input if it's positive and zero otherwise, helped mitigate some of the problems associated with sigmoid and tanh, like the vanishing gradient problem. It also made training deep networks more feasible and efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the years, as our understanding of neural network dynamics improved and the challenges of training deep networks became evident, the need for better activation functions led to the discovery and adoption of various other functions like Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU, Exponential Linear Units (ELUs), and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, the concept of activation functions has been around since the inception of artificial neurons. Still, the specific functions we use and their properties have evolved considerably as the field of neural networks has matured."

        "1. **Inputs \\((x1, x2)\\)**: These represent the input features to the neuron. In a neural network, these would correspond to either the raw input data (for input layer neurons) or the outputs of neurons from the previous layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Weights \\((w1, w2)\\)**: These are the parameters the model learns during training. They represent the strength or importance of the respective input values. In a biological neuron, these can be thought of as analogous to synaptic strengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Bias \\((b)\\)**: The bias allows the neuron to shift the activation function to the left or right, which can be crucial for successful learning. It's a kind of offset for a neuron.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Linear Combination \\((x1 \\times w1 + x2 \\times w2 + b)\\)**: Before applying the activation function, the neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs. This is the linear combination of inputs, weights, and bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Activation Function (tanh in this case)**: Once the neuron computes the linear combination, it's passed through an activation function. The `tanh` function is used here, which introduces non-linearity to the neuron's output. This non-linearity allows neural networks to model more complex relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The output \\(o\\) is the final activated value from the neuron, which can be passed to subsequent layers in a neural network or used as a final output in the case of a single-layer network.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, this code captures the fundamental operations of a neuron: weighted input summation followed by an activation. It's a foundational building block of neural networks."

        "\n",
        "Weights and gradients serve different roles in the context of neural networks, though they are both crucial to the learning process. Let's distinguish between them:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Weights**:\n",
        "   - The weights in a neural network represent the strength or importance of particular nodes or connections.\n",
        "   - They are parameters that the model learns during training. Initially, they might be set randomly or using some initialization technique.\n",
        "   - The goal of training a neural network is to adjust these weights to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual target values.\n",
        "   - In the context of your neuron example, weights (\\( w1, w2 \\)) determine how much influence each input (\\( x1, x2 \\)) has on the neuron's output.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Gradients**:\n",
        "   - Gradients are essentially derivatives. They represent the rate of change of the loss with respect to the weights (or other parameters).\n",
        "   - During training, we compute the gradients to understand how to adjust the weights to improve the model's performance. If a weight's gradient is positive, increasing that weight will increase the loss, and decreasing it will decrease the loss (and vice-versa for a negative gradient).\n",
        "   - Gradients guide the optimization process, helping determine the direction and magnitude of changes to be made to the weights during each iteration.\n",
        "   - In the context of backpropagation, gradients are propagated backward through the network to adjust weights and biases.\n",
        "\n",
        "While weights are the parameters we aim to optimize, gradients provide the direction and magnitude to adjust those weights during training. In the previous examples, gradients were computed using backpropagation and the chain rule to determine how to update weights to minimize the loss."

        "\n",
        "In this section, we're enhancing our basic computational graph structure to more seamlessly handle the process of backpropagation. The `Value` class, which represents nodes in our computational graph, will now have built-in functionality to propagate gradients backward, allowing for a more intuitive and direct calculation of derivatives. Here's a brief outline of the modifications and the reasoning behind them:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Adding Backward Functionality**:\n",
        "    - Each `Value` instance now has a `_backward` method. This method contains the logic to compute the gradient of that particular operation and pass it backward to its inputs.\n",
        "    - The `_backward` method gets defined during each operation (like addition or multiplication) and is based on the derivative of that operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Enhanced Operations**:\n",
        "    - Operations like addition (`__add__`), multiplication (`__mul__`), and the activation function `tanh` now not only compute the output but also define how to compute the gradient for their respective inputs during backpropagation.\n",
        "    - For instance, in the multiplication operation, the gradient is distributed to its operands based on the value of the other operand.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Backpropagation in Action**:\n",
        "    - After constructing the computational graph and computing the forward pass (resulting in some output or loss), we set the gradient of the final output node (typically representing the loss) to 1.\n",
        "    - We then invoke the `_backward` method of the output node, which will recursively call the `_backward` methods of its input nodes, distributing gradients based on the operation's derivative. This continues until all nodes in the graph have received their gradient.\n",
        "    - This design encapsulates the logic for gradient computation within each operation, making the process modular and intuitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the upcoming steps, by creating a computational graph using this enhanced `Value` class and then invoking the backward functionality, we will witness the gradients flow backward through the graph, solidifying our understanding of backpropagation."

        "\n",
        "#### What is Topological Sort?\n",
        "\n",
        "Topological sort is an algorithm used to linearly order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge \\( (u, v) \\), vertex \\( u \\) comes before vertex \\( v \\) in the ordering. Essentially, it provides a linear ordering of the vertices in a way that respects the directed edges of the graph. If the graph contains a cycle, then no linear ordering exists, and hence, topological sorting cannot be applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How is it Relevant to Backpropagation?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Computational Graph as a DAG**: Neural networks, or more generally, any computational graph we build for differentiable programming, can be represented as a DAG. The nodes represent computations or variables, and the edges represent the flow of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Order of Computation**: Just as in the forward pass we need to compute values in a certain sequence (you can't compute the output of a neuron before computing its inputs), in the backward pass, gradients must be computed in a specific order. Topological sorting provides the correct order for these computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Efficiency**: Computing gradients using backpropagation involves propagating the gradient backward through the graph. By using a topological sort, we ensure that every node's gradients are computed only after the gradients of the nodes that depend on it have been computed. This eliminates redundant calculations and ensures that each node's backward method is called exactly once.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Use Topological Sort in Backpropagation?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Systematic Gradient Calculation**: By processing nodes in topological order, we ensure that when we compute the gradient for a node, the gradients for all the nodes it depends on have already been computed. This ensures that the chain rule is applied systematically.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Avoid Redundancy**: Without a topological order, we might end up in situations where we compute the gradient for a node multiple times or in an incorrect order, leading to errors or inefficiencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Clarity and Structure**: Using topological sort provides a structured approach to backpropagation. It's clear which gradients need to be computed first, and this reduces the chance of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, topological sort offers a systematic and efficient way to perform backpropagation on a computational graph, ensuring that each node's gradient is computed in the correct order and precisely once."

        "## What is a Derivative?\n",
        "\n",
        "In its most basic form, the derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. Imagine driving a car on a straight road. If you were to graph the distance you traveled over time, the speed of the car at any given moment would be the rate at which the distance is changing with respect to time. This rate of change is essentially what the derivative captures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Intuitive Analogy\n",
        "\n",
        "Picture a curve representing a function on a graph. Now, choose a point on that curve. The derivative at that point is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the curve is rising, the derivative is positive (the function is increasing).\n",
        "- If the curve is flat, the derivative is zero (the function is not changing).\n",
        "- If the curve is falling, the derivative is negative (the function is decreasing).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Importance of the Derivative\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding Rate of Change**: At its core, calculus is about understanding change. The derivative provides a precise way to talk about how a function is changing at any given point.\n",
        "\n",
